        <h5 id="bio">I am a full-time teacher and part-time Computer Science student at the University of Florida. I love design and try to incoporate new styles
             whether it's in code or the classroom. I eventually wish to work in front-end development or in UX design and use these design elements in my day to day job.
             Outside of this, I have volunteer experience in education and have taught students in Teach for America.
